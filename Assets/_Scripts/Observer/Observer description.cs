// The possible use for observer design pattern //

// I may be using the observe pattern to implement winning, I will make the system find whether there -
// are any object with enemy tag are still exist in the scene, if all objects with enemy tag have -
// disappeared then I will make the system jump to the winning scene.

// It is a effective way to implement winning, and we can add or move the subscibers and publisher in -
