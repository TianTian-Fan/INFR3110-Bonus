// I did not implement the singleton pattern for player's health, but theoretically, I would make -
// two public int called maxHealth and currentHealth, and make the collision detect whether the player -
// is entering the enemy's collider, if yes, then make the maxHealth = currentHealth first, then -
// currentHealth = currentHealth minus 1. Then finally if the currentHealth reaches zero then game over.

// It is a simple way to create a health system for a game and easy to manage.
